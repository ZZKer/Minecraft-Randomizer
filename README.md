# Minecraft-Randomizer
Randomizes Minecraft recipe results and creates a datapack for use in game.
This randomizer is specifically for Minecraft version 1.13. It will not work properly in 1.14 snapshots.

How to run:

1) place all files in the same folder
2) open command prompt (windows key + R, then run "cmd")
3) change directory to the one with the files (type "cd " then the File Path name)
4) start the program by typing "java Randomize"

How to install datapack:

1) copy the folder made by the randomizer (name should read "Rand_13_0_sX" where X is the seed)
2) paste it into the "datapacks" folder in the save file you wish to play on
3) while in-game, type the command "/reload" if crafting is not randomized
